ATM:
- jquery, bootstrap, popper, gulp, slick installed via npm - getting security vulnerabilities and gulp isn't working

- Get datepicker working and styled


CSS and basic JQ transitions for demo to show Jared - once installed slick, will use that to transition (no need for BS breadcrumbs?)


TODAY

- fix map position
- different background images/fix sizing

- mapbox directions/inputs
- mapbox styling

- vehicle images
- vehicle containers
- vehicle data

THEN

- gulp
- parsley form validation
- slick carousel (column transitions, images)
- js/jq logic

      - calculate
